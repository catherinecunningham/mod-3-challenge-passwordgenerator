# Module 3 Challenge - Password Generator

Following the directions of this challenge assignment, I have created a password generator that prompts the user to create a random password with the following criteria and options:

- It must between 8 and 128 characters long.
- It may contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and special characters defined by OWASP.
- It must contain at least one type of the characters listed above.

If users do not follow the criteria for designing their password, they will receive a window alert informing them of their mistep and they will restart the password generation process.

The site was created using HTML and CSS from provided starter code, and JavaScript modified by Catherine Cunningham.  

It can be accessed at the following website:  https://catherinecunningham.github.io/mod-3-challenge-passwordgenerator/
